    Given a GC Bundle and a nonce taken from the hash of a parent bundle,
    return a new hash for the child bundle that demonstrates the child's
    lineage from the parent.

    To ensure that a consistent string representation of the GC bundle is
    used, a JSON model dump of the base bundle class is used to avoid
    automcatically generated fields such as the bundle's ID. In addition,
    only non-mutable fields are included such that lineage can be traced
    no matter the lifecycle stage the GC is in.

        granular_certificate_bundle (GranularCertificateBundle): The child GC Bundle
        nonce (str): The hash of the parent GC Bundle
